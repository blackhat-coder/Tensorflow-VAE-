This repository contains an experimental implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow. The project was developed for learning purposes, with a focus on exploring generative models through unsupervised learning.

## Overview

A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns a probabilistic mapping from input data to a latent space, allowing the generation of new data samples similar to the training distribution. VAEs are commonly used for tasks such as image generation and dimensionality reduction.

This implementation provides a customizable framework for building and training a VAE model on various datasets using TensorFlow.

## Features

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Implements the core VAE structure with an encoder to map inputs to latent variables and a decoder for reconstruction.
- **Latent Space Regularization**: Ensures the latent space follows a Gaussian distribution via the KL divergence loss component.
- **Customizable**: Modify the network architecture, including layers, units, and activation functions.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Scripts for training the model and visualizing results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
