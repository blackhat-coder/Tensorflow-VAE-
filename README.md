# Tensorflow VAE (Variational Autoencoder) âœŒ

This repository contains an experimental implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow. The project was developed for learning purposes, with a focus on exploring generative models through unsupervised learning.

Overview
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns a probabilistic mapping from input data to a latent space, allowing the generation of new data samples similar to the training distribution. VAEs are commonly used for tasks such as image generation and dimensionality reduction.

This implementation provides a customizable framework for building and training a VAE model on various datasets using TensorFlow.

Features
Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Implements the core VAE structure with an encoder to map inputs to latent variables and a decoder for reconstruction.
Latent Space Regularization: Ensures the latent space follows a Gaussian distribution via the KL divergence loss component.
Customizable: Modify the network architecture, including layers, units, and activation functions.
Training and Evaluation: Scripts for training the model and visualizing results.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/blackhat-coder/Tensorflow-VAE.git
cd Tensorflow-VAE
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset in a format compatible with the model (e.g., images in .jpg or .png format).
Train the model using the train_vae.py script:
bash
Copy code
python train_vae.py --dataset <path_to_dataset> --epochs 100
Visualize results using the visualize.py script:
bash
Copy code
python visualize.py --model_path <path_to_saved_model> --latent_dim 2
Customization
To customize the model architecture, modify the vae_model.py file. You can adjust the number of layers, the size of the latent space, and other hyperparameters.

Example
Here's a simple example of training the model on a dataset of images:

bash
Copy code
python train_vae.py --dataset ./data/images --epochs 50
This will train the VAE and save the model to the specified directory. You can then use the visualize.py script to see how the model generates new samples from the learned latent space.
